This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## DEMO

## How to run

### Google analytics setup

To setup your Google Analytics ID you will need an environment variable: `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`.
You can either set it directly into your Continuous Integration system or add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXXX-X` at the beginning of the `build` command in `package.json`

### Then

It's just a Create React App

Git clone to your machine then:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

and to watch css `yarn watch-css`
